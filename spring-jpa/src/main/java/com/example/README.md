# XML-Based vs. Annotation-Based Configuration in Spring

Spring has evolved from XML-based configuration to annotation-based configuration, making applications more maintainable, readable, and easier to manage.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary of Changes

| **XML-Based Configuration**                | **Annotation-Based Configuration**                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<bean>`                                   | `@Bean` in `@Configuration` class                                     |
| `<context:component-scan>`                 | `@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")`                        |
| `<tx:annotation-driven>`                    | `@EnableTransactionManagement`                                        |
| `persistence.xml`                           | `LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean` with Hibernate properties in Java |
| DAO and Service Beans defined in XML       | `@Repository` and `@Service` annotations                              |

## âœ¨ Advantages of Annotation-Based Configuration

âœ… **No need for XML files** â€“ Reduces configuration complexity.  
âœ… **More readable and maintainable** â€“ Annotations provide better clarity within Java classes.  
âœ… **Easy to modify and extend** â€“ Changing configurations is simpler and requires fewer files.  
âœ… **Uses Java type safety instead of XML strings** â€“ Prevents typos and errors caused by string-based XML configurations.

By leveraging annotation-based configuration, developers can create more flexible, scalable, and maintainable Spring applications.
